In this section, we will implement a simple client/server application. It will make a search
of data over the World Development Indicators of the World Bank, which you can
download from here: http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development indicators.
This data contains the values of different indicators over all the countries in the
world from 1960 to 2014.

The main characteristics of our server will be:
 * The client and the server will connect using sockets
 * The client will send its queries in a string, and the server will respond to the results in
    another string

The server can respond with three different queries:
  Query: The format of this query is
        q;codCountry;codIndicator;year where
        - codCountry is the code of the country,
        - codIndicator is the code of the indicator
        - year is an optional parameter with the year you want to query.
  The server will respond with the information in a single string.

  Report: The format of this query is
    r;codIndicator where
    - codIndicator is the code of the indicator you want to report.
    The server will respond with the mean value of that indicator for all countries over the years in a single string.

  Stop: The format of this query is z;.
   The server stops its execution when it receives this command.

In other cases, the server returns an error message.
