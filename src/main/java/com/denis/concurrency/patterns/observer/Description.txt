 According to the classic definition coined by the GoF, the intent of the Observer Pattern is to
                --------------------------------------------
        Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state,
        all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
                --------------------------------------------
 In the context of the original GoF definition, the object that is registered for updates is called an observer,
 the manager of the data of interest is called a subject, the data of interest is called the state of the subject,
 the process of registering an observer is called attaching, and the process of unregistering an observer is called detaching.
