Create a zoo system that allows a client to register and unregister listeners
that will be notified when an animal is added to the zoo. In addition, create a
 concerete listener that will print the name of the animal that is added to the zoo.

1 - A Zoo class that will act as the subject, responsible for storing a list of the animals in the zoo
    and notifying a collection of registered listeners each time a new animal is added to the zoo
2 - An Animal class that represents an animal with a name
3 - An AnimalAddedListener class that acts as the Observer interface
4 - A PrintNameAnimalAddedListener concrete observer class that prints the name of the animal that is added to the zoo
